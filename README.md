# Turtlebot 2 Setup
To setup a turtlebot 2 on a netbook, get the ISO from http://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/images/.

Create a bootable USB stick with that ISO, and boot from it.  

*Note:* You will need a computer that can connect to the internet using an ethernet cable.  If it does not have an ethernet port built-in, a usb to ethernet adapter is recommended.  

Once you have installed Ubuntu, there will be a SETUP_TTB script in the home directory that will use this repository to complete the setup on the system.
